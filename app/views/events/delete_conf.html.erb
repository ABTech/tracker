  <%= form_tag({:action => "destroy", :id => @event.id}, {:name => "delete_conf", :method => :delete}) do %>
  You have requested deletion of the event <strong><%= @event.title %></strong>.<br/><br/>

  This is not an easy task. This should not be done very often. As such, please read the following:
  <ul>
    <li><input type="checkbox" name="cond1" onChange="boxUpdate()"> Deletion should only be done on events that were mistakenly created. Events with actual data should use the "status" field for modifications.</li>
    <li> Deleted items <strong>CANNOT</strong> be recovered. Seriously, there's no way. <input type="checkbox" name="cond2" onChange="boxUpdate()"> None at all. Don't mess up.</li>
    <li> Deletion of this record will also delete all associated event_dates, location mappings, equipment profile mappings, event roles, and invoices (and the invoice's associated lines). <input type="checkbox" name="cond3" onChange="boxUpdate()"> Really, don't do this.</li>
    <li> If you mess up, delete something, and then want it back, don't email Saagar and ask, because he can't do anything for you.<input type="checkbox" name="cond4" onChange="boxUpdate()"></li>
  </ul>

  Before you can confirm deletion, check the four boxes above to confirm you really understand. In case you couldn't tell, I am not a huge fan of the deletion ability. After you do that, cross your fingers and press the magic button.<br/>

  <%= submit_tag("yeah, whatever. just shut up and do it", {:disabled => true, :name => "bigredbutton"}) %>
  <% end %>
