Hi <%= @preferred_name %>!

You're receiving this email because you were added to our mailing list. You should also be receiving an invite to join our Slack shortly. Let us know if you didn't receive one.
If you would like to be removed from the mailing list or Slack, let us know by replying to this email.

To learn more about AB Tech and what we do:

1. Check out the rest of our website at https://www.abtech.org and follow us on Instagram @cmuabtech.
2. Check out Tracker for our events at https://abtech.andrew.cmu.edu/tracker/
3. Email us if you have any questions.

During the semester, feel free to stop by and help at any of our events. Keep track of the events you attend, and after you reach 6 events, email abtech@andrew.cmu.edu and we will onboard you as a member of AB Tech.

Here's some jargon you may need to know to understand future emails:

Call time: the time you show up
Show time: the time the event actually begins
Strike time: the time you show up for cleanup
HoT: Head of Tech (me)
TiC: Techie in Charge (the person who is in charge of the individual event)
FoH: Front of House (sound) person
LD: Lighting Designer
SM: Stage Manager

One last note: if you ever hear the song Sunchyme by Dario G playing anywhere on campus, that's an indicator that AB Tech is about to start cleaning up an event. Find the source of the song and help out. This song is also known internally as the "strike song," and you can listen to it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mudQOVcdzuU

If you ever have any questions about anything, don't hesitate to email abtech@andrew.cmu.edu, and I or someone from our officer team will get back to you shortly.

Thanks,
Clarise and Stella
Heads of Tech
